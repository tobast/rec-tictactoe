Recursive Tic-tac-toe
=============

Recursive-tictactoe is a game inspired from the basic [tic-tac-toe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe "Wikipedia"), but which requires WAY more stategy to be played.
Indeed, each tic-tac-toe cell contains another tic-tac-toe. To win, you'll have to align 3 winning tic-tac-toes. But, strategy comes in when we add a new rule: when you play on, let's say, the top-left cell of a nested tic-tac-toe, you'll force the next player to play on the top-left nested tic-tac-toe!
